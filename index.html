			<h1>Colin O'Brien – Graphic designer</h1> 
		
			<p class="paragraph">I am a 19 year old artist in my first year as a Graphic Design student at Algonquin College.  I have always loved to create, whether it be drawing, painting or digital. I plan to pursue a career in art, hopefully something involving illustration. Overall I would say I am a young an willing artist; someone who is open to trying new styles. I started off as many artists do, by drawing. I’ve always loved to sketch whatever comes to my mind, for me it was the best way to convey my creativity. Growing up, I never ventured far from simple pencil drawings, but as I learned more about different styles I began to incorporate them into my designs. Most of my designs are either done by hand, or done in photoshop. I’ve recently purchased a bamboo tablet, which I’ve been using in some designs. It’s proven to be quite a useful tool and I’ve used it to paint in photoshop. Overall I would describe my style as more realistic, though I feel I have definately been influenced by comic book style. This sometimes pokes through in some of my illustrations, where I like to emphasize shadows.</p>
